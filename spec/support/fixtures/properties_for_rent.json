Infused with the glamour and cosmopolitan ease that is, simply, SoHo, 40 Mercer integrates cutting-edge design with a rich array of amenities designed by renowned hotelier Andre Balazs, including membership in the exclusive M40 Club and 24-hour hotel-style concierge service. This remarkable high-floor corner loft with private entry, 11-foot-high ceilings, vast glass curtain walls, and panoramic city views presents a truly unique opportunity-that of living in a 21st-century architectural landmark at the epicenter of a cultural and fashion mecca.",
